# Change the values of the following variables so that they point to the

# GSTLHOME: where GsTL is installed. This directory usually contains files
#           named authors, license, todo, and more importantly a directory
#           called GsTL (I know, having a GsTL directory within a directory
#           named GsTL itself is confusing...)
# GSTLAPPLI_HOME: where S-GeMS is installed
# INVENTOR_LIB: where the lib files (dll or so) for Coin (Open Inventor) are located
# INVENTOR_INCLUDE: where the .h files of Coin are located
# PYTHON_LIB: where the lib files (dll or so) for python are located (eg /usr/lib/python2.4)
# PYTHON_INCLUDE: where the .h files of python are located (eg /usr/include/python2.4)
# PYTHON_SO: the name of the python .so file, eg python2.4 if the .so file is libpython2.4.so
